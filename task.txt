Infra Dev Trial Task (3 hours)

- Make a Golang Rest API which fetches the Solana balance of a user.

- RPC: https://pomaded-lithotomies-xfbhnqagbt-dedicated.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=37ba4475-8fa3-4491-875f-758894981943
- Docs on how to get Solana balance of a user: https://github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go?tab=readme-ov-file#index--rpc--getbalance

Requirements
- IP rate limiting > 10 requests per minute.
- Each wallet address needs a cache TTL of 10 seconds.
- If 2 concurrent requests are made for the same wallet address, the second request should wait for the first one to finish and then return the same result. (Mutex & Cache Usage)
- MongoDB Authentication -> Store Valid API Keys in a Database -> When your endpoint is requested, validate the API key using the database.
- The API must respond as fast as possible.

Rest API Structure

POST /api/get-balance

```go
Body = {
    "wallets": [ARRAY_OF_SOLANA_WALLETS]
}
```

Testing - You must show a video of...
- The rest API working with 1 wallet.
- The rest API working with multiple wallets.
- The rest API working with 5 requests using the same wallet.
- The rest API working with all of the above at the same time.
- The rest API working with IP rate limiting.
- The rest API working with caching.
- Testing authentication and rate limiting.
